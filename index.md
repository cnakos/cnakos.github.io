## Constantine Nakos

I am a PhD candidate at Northwestern University.  My advisor is [Ken Forbus](https://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/).  My research aims to make Natural Language systems easier to debug by having the system ask the user diagnostic questions in natural language.  Through a series of such questions, the system will be able to locate the error in its linguistic knowledge and correct it, allowing non-expert users to help improve the system's understanding.  I have also done research on cognitively plausible models of reference resolution, and I help maintain the Qualitative Reasoning Group's information kiosk.
