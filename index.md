## Constantine Nakos

I am a PhD candidate at Northwestern University.  My advisor is [Ken Forbus](https://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/).  My main area of research is Natural Language Processing, including Understanding and Generation.  Specifically, I am working on Interactive Natural Language Debugging, a method for hand-curated natural language systems to debug themselves by asking a user questions.  I have also done work on reference resolution, and I help maintain QRG's question-answering Kiosk.
